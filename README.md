# Lévy Spectral Kernel Learning

MATLAB code for spectral kernel learning using Lévy process priors.

The main file is test_script.m, which loads data and calls all other functions. The script guides the user through initialization procedures, calls RJ-MCMC, computes predictive distributions for unobserved test points, and plots diagnostics.
